# Musubi /　結び

Social Media intended to gamify connecting people, and help people meet others
online.

##### Planned Features:
  - Connect with someone based on location, age, gender
  - See someone else's social media feed and try to figure out who they are
  - Use pictures(like QR code) to check that when people meet in person that they are near each other


> Musubi is an app that allows people to connect with other people
> and gamifying it to figure out who the other person is
> and in the process finding out what kind of person the other one is.
> It's designed to work best in cities, where people are near each other, and find
> it hard to connect with other people. In a city, there are so many people, yet it can
> be very lonely sometimes, and this application is supposed to help resolve that.
